/** HMChatOperatorAvailabilityCheck is a simple class that allows an app to check if any operators are available for a specific Hipmob app.
 
 As an example, if you'd like to only show the live chat button when an operator is available, you can implement the HMChatViewAvailabilityCheckDelegate protocol and then create an instance of [HMChatOperatorAvailabilityCheck](./Classes/HMChatOperatorAvailabilityCheck.html). This will make the necessary network calls to the Hipmob chat network and then invoke the appropriate delegate methods. For example, here we call the method in the viewDidAppear function.
 
     - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
     {
     [super viewDidAppear:animated];
     
     HMChatOperatorAvailabilityCheck * check = [[HMChatOperatorAvailabilityCheck alloc] initWithAppID:@"2ea7d86854df4ca185af84e68ea72fe1" andNotify:self];
     }
 
 And in the delegate methods we change the background color of the live chat button to orange if there are no operators available, or green if there are.
